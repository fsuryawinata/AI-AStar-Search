# AI A* Heuristic Search

This project is an AI which finds the shortest distance to an enemy piece in a custom game, Inflexion using A* heuristic search. 

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI designed to efficiently navigate the Inflexion game board and find the shortest path to enemy pieces using the A* heuristic search algorithm. For detailed performance metrics and analysis, refer to the `report.pdf` included in this repository.

## Getting Started

To run the code, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python -m search < test.csv
```
where test.csv can be any test file
